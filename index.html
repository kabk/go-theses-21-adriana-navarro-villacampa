			To what extent can a graphic designer manifest free-will whilst creating visual content for Instagram?
		</p>
		<p>
			<!-- <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
				The rise of social media puts the concept of individuality in danger. Data mining, unclear privacy laws, algorithms and other tools that manipulate our behaviour,etc. All these dangers are present in the social media behemoth called Instagram.
				<br>
A growing concern for the individual presence on this platform interlaced with personal responsibility soon clashed with the prospect of creating a profile through which to share my work as a graphic designer. Already in the beginning I had an inclination to say that existentialism and Instagram could never coexist. Research only further confirmed this: from reading, listening and watching multiple other sources to personally analysing visuals, the platform and its technical characteristics and limitations.
				<br>
Personally, it has yet to be proven to me if graphic designers can visually manifest free-will on the app. Or perhaps it is manifesting, right under our noses and I remain unaware for the time being.

				<h1 id="intro" >INTRODUCTION</h1>
				<p>After its birth on October 6th, 2010, Instagram is an ever-powerful beast that strives forth and has ultimate reign over all other social media platforms. Through the consistent updates of its interface, it has consequently absorbed other
					social media networks’ features
   <sup class="ft" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
					to turn into a more favourable environment that agrees with a larger audience, resulting in this laid back space in which one can be themselves. In fact, people have welcomed it so much into their life that it
					has become a ritual for the Instagram user to scroll endlessly through it on particular moments of the day. It is limited, easy to use, with an interface that doesn’t offer too many options but just enough of them that the user doesn’t get lost
					in the world of possibility. The use of Instagram is addictive and is spiralling rapidly downwards into a pit of psychological issues. And one of these key issues is individuality, the individual self.
				</p>
				<p>The subject of individuality can be addressed rather superficially in reference to this app, criticising it for being a platform for social pressures that result in serious detrimental mental issues. Many have written about this, and still
					do, especially in the light of the COVID-19 crisis, which turn people away from physical social interaction and instead turn them to digital means, along with the factor of the stay at home policy, and thus remaining at home without external
					forms of entertainment.
						<sup class="ft" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2 </a></sup>
						<sup class="ft" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote"> 3, </a></sup>
						<sup class="ft" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote"> 4 </a></sup>
					<p>Yet this isn’t the direct concern of this thesis, the focus is upon the graphic designer interacting with this app, creating content for it.
						<p>It is not rare to hear art mentors say “the rules are meant to be broken” to encourage the outpour of creativity from their students. Yet how far can the rules be broken on Instagram, in terms of creating content and visuals? For the sake
							of
							individuality, can designers create visuals that challenge and push these boundaries?
							<p>And if graphic designers run into the fact that existentialism cannot coexist with Instagram, what then are the alternatives?
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h1 id= "basics"> THE BASICS
</h1>

								<h2>Why the topic of existentialism now? / Where am I positioned in this?</h2>
								<p>In order to fully comprehend whether or not one can be existentialist in the social media age and in social media itself, a few matters must be addressed. The first would be the relation of the individual identity to existentialism, and
									what existentialism itself is. Founded in Paris after the Second World War, existentialism was a response to oppressive regimes and more specifically the trials of Nazi party figures that claimed that they could not be accounted for their
									actions, or otherwise tried, because they were merely following orders from superiors. Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and other philosophers at the time argued that every human being is what they make of themselves; one is free and
									yet
									responsible, of one’s own actions and choices. And in turn, all the actions one takes affect all others. It is in these beliefs that existentialism is founded. In relation to the individual, Sartre uses existentialist theory as a means for
									a
									person to self-reflect. To examine their life for emulation of “bad faith” and to become more aware of oppression and exploitation in the world, as a means to reflect on past events and avoid their recurrence.
															<sup class="ft" id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote"> 5 </a></sup>
									<br />
									<br />The awareness of the individual self begins in child development. There are three types of self. The first is the existential self, which comes with a “sense of being separate and distinct from others and the awareness of the constancy of the self” (Bee, 1992).
															<sup class="ft" id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"> 6 </a></sup>
									A person, or in Bee’s theory a child realises that they exist as a separate entity to everyone else and continue to exist and live as it, as does everything around them.
									<br />
									<br />The second is the categorical self. This is when a child becomes aware that they exist as an object also in relation to the world. And thus, begin to categorise themselves by different aspects. Aspects that other objects have, such as physical features, as well as, later on, internal psychological traits, comparative evaluations and how others see them. This goes hand in hand with the relational self, which “reflects dyadic bonds or attachments (e.g., romantic liaisons, friendships)” (Sedikides & Brewer, 2002).
															<sup class="ft" id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"> 7 </a></sup>
									Meaning that through categorising, they are creating relationships and bonds with other members of society.
									<br />
									<br />The last, and third, is the collective self, that reflects how a person belongs to certain groups of people through similarity and identifies its membership to it.
									<sup class="ft" id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote"> 7 </a></sup>
									<br />
									<br />There is a clear relevance to how the first applies to Sartre’s existentialist theory —aside from the term used in its categorisation; it quite forwardly speaks of personal awareness to the surrounding world and the existence of all occurring around one self. However, it does not make one accountable for one’s own actions per se, but purely explains that the subject is fully aware when it comes to positioning themselves in space and time. On the other hand, the categorical self is relating its position to the world. It is like this that a person becomes free as well as responsible; by accepting one’s existence, existing in itself. Their behaviour decides actively what groups they are categorised into, or rather apply themselves to. In this there is a risk, however, that contradicts Sartre’s own theory to some degree. Because, by the ways that they are labelling their person, they are deciding a set of behaviours that will be associated with them upon entering a group.
									<br />
									<br />Then there are those that are blissfully unaware that they are being influenced: if they claim to be free, and see themselves as free regardless, but are influenced by others… Is that self not a free self, and can that self really be held responsible for any actions they do? Who is to determine what “free” is, then? Sartre states that an “individual is free because he escapes from being a form of consciousness”.
									<sup class="ft" id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote"> 8 </a></sup>
									In the aforementioned case, the person is unaware, unconscious, of their actions being their own. This is also what Sartre himself addresses through the statement in which “no limits to (my) freedom can be found except freedom itself or, if
									you prefer, that we are not free to cease being free” (Sartre, 1943). It can be argued that then individuals are not free at all, or perhaps, that they are being forced to make certain choices, be it by their external environmental factors.
									<br />
									<br />Is one not affected by the actions and behaviours of that group in which they are in, in order to remain part of that group? Of course, Sartre claims that one will be held responsible for one’s own actions. And still, the actions of a single member of that group affect everyone else. Additionally, the external judgement of a group of people is also a factor that will influence people to act differently. In his philosophy, Sartre also highlights that part of being existentialist means to continuously reinvent oneself.
									<sup class="ft" id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote"> 6 </a></sup>
									Hence, we are ever changing. Humans being such responsive and emotional animals, how free of will are they truly? With the new age of algorithms and the over exposition of imagery, information— both factual and fake, censorship, all of
									which are fed to the user through LED screens, with all this fanfare of influencing factors, how free is a social media user then?
									<br />
									<br />Carl Jung (1935) addresses this coming together of the conscious and unconsciousness of a person, through individuation theory. The personal and collective integrate into a single person, in self-realisation, and through this process of individuation a person becomes whole. To be above the influences and actions of a collective, then the subject would have to pass through the process of individuation that Jung discusses in his psychology-based theory. It is in this manner that a person would be fully aware of the external factors that have an effect on them, aware of the possibilities and restrictions of their actions,to which they can then be held responsible for, as Sartre states in existentialism that they should be.
									<br />
									<br />It would be easy to dismiss existentialism as a past dilemma, related to war crimes and far away moral conflicts. A heated political climate: extremism rising, the digital proving to be capable of not only manipulating us into buying certain items but also manipulating our political decisions, and the crisis of COVID-19… All these social circumstances have one conclusive thought, which is that our choices matter and our free-will is precious. Our actions define and affect those around us more than ever before, as arguably the individual in the Western world has never had  as much power as they do now. Add to this our possibility to be informed is enforced by the Internet and multiple search engines.
									<br />
									<br /> The coming together of individuals on social media platforms has proven this. In 2018, a simple tweet from singer Rihanna shaming Snapchat for mocking her assault experience resulted in a ripple carried by her followers. It tore into the app’s stock and sent plummeting 800 million dollars.
									<sup class="ft" id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote"> 9 </a></sup>
									It is no secret now that on a daily basis we all ignore the lack of privacy we have on Instagram, how we have openly agreed to sell our lives and soul to the untouchable Mark Zuckerberg and his minions who sell our data without our well
									informed consent to the highest bidder. How we let ourselves be manipulated, continuously. It is normalised to such a degree that despite this awareness we continue to submit to using their products (Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and
									Messenger). We are cattle in the big market of profitable personal data, the new gold.
									<br />
									<br />In history class, we talk in retrospect about the manipulation techniques the Nazis used, with their propaganda and their social appeal to a starving, suffering population. In psychology class, we look into the different experiments carried out in reflection to the Nuremberg trials, such as that of the Milgram experiment, to psycho-analyse the “how” of manipulation. In philosophy class, we argue what it means to be an individual. We feel anger, we feel disgust, shock, we discuss and sometimes argue as we inevitably reflect.
									<br />
									<br />The bell rings.
									<br />
									<br />The hallways overflow with students. Routinely, they pull out their phone and click the abstracted white camera with its warm toned gradient. And like that, all we have learnt has served for no purpose. We open up a door for history to repeat itself.
									<br />
									<br />For a moment, let’s hypothesize and make a few statements that at a later point can be confirmed or disproved, or perhaps new ones may arise all together. The possibilities are open. An existentialist graphic designer would be acting on free-will when posting on Instagram. This expands beyond the ideas of just freely posting whatever one wants whenever they want, expressing then and there their ideas.
									<br />
									<br />There are two ways that I can foresee the graphic designer being an existentialist on Instagram. The first is in the visual form of their content, that pushes the boundaries of Instagram and rejects the construction and philosophy of it. The second is the information transmitted across their work, signalling to users that one cannot be free whilst using Instagram, or at least not on the platform itself.
									<br />
									<br />The other answers to this question of the existentialist designer on Instagram abandon the idea of the two subjects overlapping at all; it is the belief that a person who acts on free-will cannot exist on Instagram, that their individuality is crushed all together.
									<br />
									<br />Now, here I am. Staring at my multicoloured screen, with the app open. My photos, fit to the technical details of Instagram, my identity refrained there to fit this grid. Hours spent on YouTube, watching as Mark Zuckerberg is repeatedly butchered by lawmakers, in America, in Europe, who outline his invasive manipulate systems within Facebook and Instagram, the damage these platforms cause to mental health, etc. Equally, I have seen multiple headlines over the years screaming out about the loss of individuality, the million manipulation techniques, all damage Instagram has caused —and causes— to the creative field,
									<sup class="ft" id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote"> 10,  </a></sup>
									<sup class="ft" id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote"> 11 </a></sup>
								 and here I am, still holding my phone in my hand. Well aware that all the images I post I lose ownership to, knowing that my microphone and camera have been turned on thousands of times to spy on me, and that at times my
									habits on the app have been obsessive and addictive. Disgusted, furious at times… and yet I still have room to be conflicted about clicking both “delete account” and “uninstall”.

									<br />
									<br />To be on Instagram is to be present in society, because the vast majority of the population is on the app itself. Really; the structure of it is so simple, so basic, that even your grandparents could find their way around it without much complication. And they do! For graphic designers, along with other creatives, it is the ideal place to showcase their work. Many get job offers through here or are discovered by clients and studios. Even bigger older studios, brought to fame prior to the social media age, now have accounts on the app to be followed closely through. Their presence is enforced by Instagram.<br />
									<br />
As a young designer, about to step out into the professional world, I often find myself debating what to do. Up to this point, I have had a personal account which I kept on &ldquo;private&rdquo; mode, granting only access to my closest friends, family and classmates. Months pass between post and post, and now the periods for which I don&rsquo;t post extend more and more. My stories have become a rare sighting, and often they are to share memes or posts of other users. Two hundred and nine followers which I could easily filter down to fifteen or so that I actually would like following my content, and from those fifteen I only share my actual life with potentially six, excluding my two siblings and the ghost account of my mother. All that sharing occurs outside of Instagram itself anyhow. I never cared to use Instagram to prove my worth or what I am doing, nor to display my work or creative processes. The last straw to sway me from posting my work online was the spill on the copyright of images on Instagram, and how the platform was free to use any of my images and video as they pleased. Ultimately, my usage of the app is to bookmark&mdash;or in insta-terms &ldquo;save&rdquo;&mdash;others&rsquo; work and inspiration, and the occasional video of a soft animal.<br />
									<br />
The doubts that surface often rotate around whether my presence would be diminished without Instagram and if I would miss out on opportunities without the platform. On one hand, I see myself wanting nothing more to do with Facebook and its subproducts. And on the other, the only exception in which I could see myself ignoring all previous knowledge I have of Instagram and remaining on the platform for professional use would be in the instance that I find a way to post creative content that still allows for my individual expression. With this research I hope to find the answer to this annually lingering question that will guide me forwards to take the decisive steps to quit or submit to Instagram as a graphic designer; if it is possible for my visual work to co-exist within Instagram or if the construction of it annuls it.<br />

									<h1 id= "philosophy">
The Philosophy of Instagram
</h1>

									<p>
										The focus of this chapter is on the philosophical way in which Instagram functions as a social media platform.<br>
										<br>
The Czech philosopher Vil&eacute;m Flusser wrote about the changing technical image in the 1980s in his book &ldquo;Into the Universe of Technical Images&rdquo;.He defines technical images as being primarily photographs, as well as digital images on screens, monitors, projections including holograms. These images are not created by a manual process or manual machinery and are therefore not physical. This process of creating them, this process of visualisation is consequently automated.<br>
										<br>
For him, these technical images first come in during the early developments of the photograph, that we can say is then the late 1800s, which is when, focused on Western society, the image becomes of greater value than the written word. Prior to this, the written word held a high importance as it helps us date history, and prior to that period is the &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo; in which rock and wood mainly is used to create images that communicate greater meanings, based on spoken word. The technical image relies on text to be fully explained and contextualised. According to Flusser, because images replace text, we see ourselves and the world around us as images are: two-dimensional, dependent on context, scene.<br>
										<br>
The construction of these digital images is also key to understanding Instagram; they are then made up of pixels and coding. Flusser describes this as being &ldquo;concretizations&rdquo;, that is to say &ldquo;calculations and computations&rdquo; of abstract particles. Therefore, they are only a visualisation, an illusion. It is the image of a house, not a house itself. As Ren&eacute; Magritte reminds us &ldquo;ceci n&rsquo;est pas une pipe&rdquo;.<br>
										<br>
Throughout the text, Flusser warns us about the danger of these images, as they are created through automatised processes. One can argue that a photographer adjusts the settings on their camera to make the image appear as they wish, which is a manual task, but the actual shutter speed, the lighting, down to the actual root of it, is made automatic by the camera. The machinery of the camera does it itself, with a photographer&rsquo;s aid, but as Flusser declares it is not comparable to wood carving, for example. From there stems his argument in that people are becoming lazier in terms of thinking, as they do not have to put thought and consideration into what they do, in comparison to the previous age of writing. A writer plans the order of their words, the meaning, the tone, revises them. A person making a digital image, according to him, simply snaps the photo. It is within our interest to consider Flusser&rsquo;s reflection as a tool to analyse our perception of the images on Instagram.
										<br>
										<br>
Now let us consider all this philosophy in the context of Instagram. Firstly, the user is seeing visualisations of the world around them. These are not the real world, these are a perspective, filtered and edited view of the world. To add to this that now images are edited in apps, created using artificial intelligence, these images, these illusions are even further distorted from reality. They are barely a conception of it.<br>
<br />
Secondly, these illusions render to nothingness. It is a decaying set of pixels, and we are aware that this image is not real, that it is composed of RGB dots. Therefore, Instagram creates a whole world, a whole dependency on the void of nothingness. The internet is fragile, apps are fragile, dependent on factors such as the resolution quality of devices, satellite connection and electricity, which at times could and does fail. Jaron Lanier outlines that the way social media platforms were created was by mimicking gambling machines; there is a set of actions a user must do and for those they get instant gratification. These, like gambling, create dependencies, they create addictions even if they do not appear so at first. So much so that gambling sites now come to learn from social media how to better their tools. Combining these two concepts, Instagram is a platform that encourages users, people, to become addicted to nothingness. A world where, as Flusser says, the idea of true and false does not exist, but rather evaluates the world based on concreteness and abstractness. It is between fiction and reality, and sometimes it is both. And it is used every day for people to record and base their lives around. We, users of Instagram, are living on nothing.<br>
<br>
A platform which rotates around the technical image &mdash;the production, consumption and handling of these images&mdash;is a no-thinking headspace, according to Flusser. These automated processes do not encourage deep thought, or calculation, and therefore what we create is purely thoughtless, superficial illusions of our world.<br>
<br>
The community aspect of Instagram means that there is a constant social interaction going on. This process of production of content is divided into those that create the content (images and video) and those that &ldquo;consume&rdquo; this content. Be it by saving this content (in an archiving sense) or by providing feedback through likes, shares and comments. This is part of that Instagram philosophy, in which the user gives feedback to the account that creates material. And regarding this aspect, graphic designers thrive.<br>
<br>
It is this instant feedback system which provides rating directly to the designer. The success of a work can be judged on numbers; likes, shares, follows. Their success is directly quantifiable. It is also an important means through which socialisation takes place on an international level. Since Instagram has become such a social media behemoth, many millions of users are present online. It facilitates the interaction of knowing somebody from the other side of the world without having to have the means by which to travel there and become directly acquainted with people within that social circle first hand. It is a social shortcut in many ways. People can interact, collaborate and discuss. Which has massive appeal to graphic designers, for it provides opportunities of finding creatives to produce the best outcomes in a collaboration, for example, without the reliance and limitation of only those that you know face to face.<br>
<br>
Additionally, it is an instant filter. Immediately, from a profile preview one can see the quality of work and judge it (particularly in the graphic design field, which is about transmitting messages visually) and have the creator readily accessible. There is no intermediary to have to approach, but directly the designer themselves.<br>
<br>
Algorithms also play a big role in the interactivity element. The infamous algorithm will show the user related accounts based on certain similarities by cross comparing with other accounts: common followers, common likes, same use of certain hashtags. And in this manner, it does a level of networking that would otherwise require socially interacting<br>
<br>
However, one cannot ignore that the construction of Instagram represents its philosophy. Whilst it provides a level of interactivity, of feedback between the viewer and the account, it is very limited. There are many more platforms and forums that allow the sending of screenshots or images in the comment section, to back up an argument. Or allow the simple function of referencing back to previous messages from the same discussion whilst still replying to the original poster (the main account, in this case). Even on a simpler basis, these platforms allow hyperlinks to be sent in a comment and allow them to be clicked, whilst Instagram sends it just as text and thus kills the whole purpose of a hyperlink. These all are factors that enrich the discussion and qualify as feedback.<br>
<br>
With this said, it is obvious that the philosophy of Instagram is to have a limited level of social interaction. Human beings rely on social interaction, being social and emotional animals, and Instagram supplies just barely that whilst embracing the idea of ego and the monologue. For graphic designers seeking a conversation, seeking actual feedback, this is not the ideal platform for it. It is instead the ideal place to go window shopping. The viewer can see, like a portfolio, a sample of the graphic designer&rsquo;s work and if curiosity is peaked, then they will take the step further of approaching and engaging in conversation. And because Instagram is so limited in its interaction, oftentimes the conversation is taken outside of the platform itself.<br>
<br>
In fact, the latest Instagram update that took place in November 2020 clearly establishes the direction the app is taking. On the bottom toolbar of the app, there used to be five central icons. From left to right: &ldquo;home&rdquo; which showed the feed, &ldquo;search&rdquo; which let users navigate the search feed and specifically search hashtags or accounts, &ldquo;post&rdquo; which users clicked when they wanted to post an image or video, &ldquo;activity&rdquo; which showed the comments, likes, followers and other information directly connected to the user, and finally the personal profile icon which takes the user to their own profile. In the update, the central icon for posting content was replaced with the IGTV reels icon. The next icon left of it which showed the activity of the user was replaced with a shopping bag, showing the user items they can buy from all the accounts that they follow. The &ldquo;post&rdquo; and &ldquo;activity&rdquo; icons were moved instead to the top of the feed.<br>
<br>
Since the philosophy clearly translates through the user interface of the app, it is pretty clear what this means; the personal existence of the user has become secondary to the consumption of content. The icons on the bottom, most accessible, now all rotate around the idea of consumption be it by watching, finding or buying. The user&rsquo;s presence is secondary now: by putting those two icons in the top right corner, they are automatically harder to access anatomically for a human being. Our thumbs don&rsquo;t reach all the way up there on the screen, it requires an extra effort for us to click these.<br>

<br>
So much for being a &ldquo;social&rdquo; media platform.<br>
The more people use this social media, the more the philosophy of it becomes part of our world. Jaron Lanier, amongst other philosophers and former social media creators continue to outline how it is changing how we socially interact. Our addictions to these gambling machine carbon copies result in abnormal behaviour, outlined by Jaron Lanier in &ldquo;Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now&rdquo;. <br>
For creatives to stay on this platform means the death of creativity and imaginative processes themselves if we take these previous arguments into consideration. As graphic designers, we strive to design future change. This future change doesn&rsquo;t begin simply in the identities or other projects we create, it begins at the heart of the matter which is shaping society. To nurture these sites by creating content for them means to feed this monster. Of course, there is the counter argument of social connectivity, although limited, that this app provides. The aspect of exposure, easy access to people of multiple audiences. Yet, surely this is not the only means to achieve this. <br>
<br>
<br />
<br />
<br />

<h1 id="answer">The Answer to the Pending Question: to Stay or to Leave?</h1>
<br>
There is a tree of answers to respond to this question, and surely I cannot address all of them, but here I outline a few. <br>
<br>
Ideally, by this point I should have highlighted why, as a graphic designer, or let alone an individual, it is important to be existentialist and consider our presence on Instagram rather strongly. Without going into moral arguments, about legal implications, about mental health, all of which are broadly discussed every passing year Instagram continues to thrive. The Social Dilemma, Hypernormalisation, Jaron Lanier, Cal Newport, Your Undivided Attention; endless and endless articles online, documentaries, books, TED talks, informed by former experts in the field of social media development, can tell you tirelessly about the aforementioned themes. <br>
<br>
The first question is on being an existentialist. One can choose to not be existentialist, to let themselves be dragged by the tide. To which one can only wonder if self-fulfillment is achieved, if one becomes just a puppet of the world, or if it is even possible to not be a slightest bit existentialist. <br>
<br>
Then one can choose to be existentialist, to take hold of the reigns of their life and question their actions. Though it is a more strenuous path, I find this to be more freeing and to impose on us a level of personal awareness. The harder road does become easier with time. To stay on Instagram, by one&rsquo;s own will, is a form of practicing it. And so is not posting content that challenges the Instagram layouts or questions our presence on the app. <br>
<br>
<h2>To Stay</h2>
Let&rsquo;s assume one opts to stay on Instagram. There is the option of actively acting against the platform whilst on it, or else, to be passive. <br>
<br>
To stay and act against it, then. There are a few examples I have gathered that clearly challenge the trends or any reasoning of the app, as a preparation to gather more visuals at a later point and gradually create my own as part of my final graduation project. The connection I now wish to find is these visual manifestations in relation to graphic design specifically. <br>

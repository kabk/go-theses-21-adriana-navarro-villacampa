	<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>After its birth on October 6th, 2010, Instagram is an ever-powerful beast that strives forth and has ultimate reign over all other social media platforms. Through the consistent updates of its interface, it has consequently absorbed other social media networks’ features to turn into a more favourable environment that agrees with a larger audience, resulting in this laid back space in which one can be themselves. In fact, people have welcomed it so much into their life that it has become a ritual for the Instagram user to scroll endlessly through it on particular moments of the day. It is limited, easy to use, with an interface that doesn’t offer too many options but just enough of them that the user doesn’t get lost in the world of possibility. The use of Instagram is addictive and is spiralling rapidly downwards into a pit of psychological issues. And one of these key issues is individuality, the individual self.
</p>
<p>The subject of individuality can be addressed rather superficially in reference to this app, criticising it for being a platform for social pressures that result in serious detrimental mental issues. Many have written about this, and still do, especially in the light of the COVID-19 crisis, which turn people away from physical social interaction and instead turn them to digital means, along with the factor of the stay at home policy, and thus remaining at home without external forms of entertainment., , </p>
<p>Yet this isn’t the direct concern of this thesis, the focus is upon the graphic designer interacting with this app, creating content for it.
<p>It is not rare to hear art mentors say “the rules are meant to be broken” to encourage the outpour of creativity from their students. Yet how far can the rules be broken on Instagram, in terms of creating content and visuals? For the sake of individuality, can designers create visuals that challenge and push these boundaries?
<p>And if graphic designers run into the fact that existentialism cannot coexist with Instagram, what then are the alternatives?
